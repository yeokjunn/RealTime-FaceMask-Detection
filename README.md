# RealTime-FaceMask-Detection
This repository contains a real-time face mask detection program built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. 
The project leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not through a live webcam feed.

## **Project Structure**

- **`FaceMask_Detection (Updated).ipynb`**:  
  A Jupyter notebook containing the main program for real-time face mask detection. It handles loading the trained model, processing webcam input, and performing predictions.
  
- **`mask_detector2.keras`**:  
  The trained Keras model used for detecting face masks.
